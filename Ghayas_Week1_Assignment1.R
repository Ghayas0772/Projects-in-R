## THE ASSIGNMENT BEGINS HERE

## For each question, write the code you would use to answer the question (some questions have more than one possible answer)
## For questions asking for both code and a short written response, use the # to write a short response to the question 
## Don't forget to save your work directly in this codefile

# written Note:
#To compare age histograms from a random sample and the full #dataset, create and inspect both. Load libraries, 
#read the #data, filter out missing ages, draw a random sample of 10, #and plot histograms for both sets.
#The full dataset #histogram shows a smoother, more representative age, distribution, while the sample histogram is more irregular 
#due to the smaller size. The full dataset's higher #frequency counts contrast with the sample's lower counts 
#and greater variability, underscoring the importance of #larger samples for reliable analysis
