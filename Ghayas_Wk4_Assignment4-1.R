 """ Q3. Research Question: Absences Explained by Romantic Relationship
Q3.a.Empty Model (baseline model):
  o	Task : Fit an empty model (without explanatory variables) for absences.
Q3.b.	Question: What is the model statement for the empty model, and how do you interpret the estimated parameters?
  •	Explanatory Model (including romantic relationship variable):
  o	Task: Add romantic relationship status (coded as X) to the model.
Q3.c.	Question: How is the explanatory variable (romantic relationship) coded?
Q3.d.	Question: What is the model statement for the explanatory model, and how do you interpret the estimated parameters?
  •	Comparison of Models (empty vs. explanatory):
  o	Task: Create an APA-style table using the supernova() function for model comparison.
Q3.e.	Question: What do the F ratio, degrees of freedom, and difference in parameters between the models tell you?
Q3.f	Question: What is the Proportion Reduction in Error (PRE), and how does it measure the strength of the explanatory model?
Q3.g. Question: What is Cohen’s d, and how does it measure the effect size and strength of the relationship?
